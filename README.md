# Pakistan Telecom Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry of Pakistan. The dataset used contains customer attributes and their churn status, helping businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies. This machine learning model analyzes customer data and predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the service, allowing proactive retention measures.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques
- Machine Learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **File:** `churnData.csv`
- **Description:** Contains customer attributes and churn status.
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (1 = Churned, 0 = Not Churned)

## ðŸ›  Installation
